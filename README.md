# Knotty
A simple package repository, built as a practical evaluation of modern Python libraries (namely FastAPI and Typer).

Contains two programs:

- [knotty](./knotty) is the repository backend; provides access to the database via an HTTP API.
- [knot](./knot) is a CLI client for the repository.
